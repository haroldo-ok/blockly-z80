===========

Blockly adapted to generate Z80 code.

Work in progress; currently, fixed loops and string output are functional. 

Take a look at index.html to see what it can do: the demo provides you with a [Blockly] editor that generates Z80 assembly code in real time as it is modified; the code is shown on a side panel; the generated ASM code is also automatically assembled using [bitz80]. The generated Sega Master System ROM is fully functional can be dowloaded with a simple button click.
